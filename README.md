# Machine Learning Journey with Python

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning repository! This project documents my journey into the world of Machine Learning using Python, sharing code, projects and key learnings along the way.

## Overview

This repository serves as both a personal learning log and a resource for others interested in ML. I'll be sharing:

- Code implementations of ML algorithms
- Practice projects and experiments  
- Learning resources and notes
- Practical examples and use cases

## Structure

```
├── projects/       # Complete ML projects
